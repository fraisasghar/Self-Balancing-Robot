# Self-Balancing-Robot
Self balancing robot with ultrasonic sensor is a two wheeled system that maintains upright balance using real time PID control and an inertial sensor. An ultrasonic sensor detects obstacles and enables safe movement. The project demonstrates control systems, embedded programming, and robotics integration.
